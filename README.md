# Additional Feature: "WaterLevel"
The additional feature introduces a factor called "waterLevel," which affects the environment of the farm. If the waterLevel exceeds the limit (+-10 for crops, +-25 for the farm), your crops will die, and you will lose the game if it reaches 25.

To bring the waterLevel back to its normal state, the user can buy a totem from the store. Currently, only the weather totem is available.

Every day, the "Weather" will signal what will happen on the farm. The weather conditions could be "rain," "flood," "drought," or "sunny/normal." Depending on which event occurs, the waterLevel will either increase or decrease.
